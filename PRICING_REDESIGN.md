## Design Decisions

### Why Multiple Tiers?
1. **Market Segmentation:** Free → Starter → Pro → Enterprise captures all customer types
2. **Anchor Pricing:** Enterprise "Custom" makes Pro ($29) seem reasonable
3. **Clear Upgrade Path:** Users see natural progression as needs grow
4. **Lead Qualification:** Different tiers attract different customer profiles

### Why Show Pricing at Waitlist Stage?
1. **Set Expectations:** Users know what they're signing up for
2. **Filter Leads:** Only serious prospects join specific tier waitlists
3. **Build Perceived Value:** Seeing tiers makes pro features feel more valuable
4. **Reduce Churn:** No surprise pricing when launching

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Pro Tier Most Prominent:**
   - Gradient background (stands out visually)
   - "BEST VALUE" badge
   - Positioned as recommended option
2. **Free Tier Least Prominent:**
   - Plain white background
   - Shows limitations (no password protection)
   - Gray CTA button
3. **Enterprise Tier Premium Feel:**
   - Dark sophisticated styling
   - "Custom" pricing creates exclusivity

## Key Takeaway

The landing page now positions DropDF as a **professional document sharing platform with a free tier**, rather than a **free tool with a vague pro option**. This shift:

1. ✅ Attracts higher-value customers
2. ✅ Sets clear pricing expectations
3. ✅ Builds perceived value of pro features
4. ✅ Creates urgency with early access offers
5. ✅ Maintains free tier for virality and growth

The redesign transforms the page from a utility tool into a growth-focused SaaS landing page optimized for converting paying customers.
